										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CarStereo1.jpg" /><br />            Car stereos have come a long way from static-y AM radio to the infotainment hubs they are today. Car stereos have become one of the more important options to consider when purchasing a car or upgrading the existing setup in your vehicle. Smartphone integration is also a key factor, and with that evolution, car stereos have become more than just something that plays tunes while driving.<br />

                    No longer just a mere accessory, car stereos must play and stream music in different formats, connect to our smartphones, navigate for us, and even play videos (while the car is parked). Some new vehicles have stereos that meet the needs of today’s drivers, but what about those situations where you are looking to replace a broken or upgrade an outdated car stereo? The choices are numerous and varied, just as with any other on-the-go infotainment needs. There are many things to consider when selecting a car stereo, and these are some of the best car stereos available.</p>

<p>                                                            Adjustable 11-inch capacitive touchscreen<br />

                                                            Expensive<br />

<p>            The Alpine Halo11 iLX511 features the best touchscreen you can find on a car stereo. Measuring a gigantic 11-inch, the screen is floating with adjustability for height, depth, and viewing angle. The display resolution is eye-catching and crisp at 1280 x 720 pixels and is also very responsive. However, despite the size of the touchscreen, the iLX511 fits most single-DIN openings.<br />
                    More than just a pretty face, the iLX511 has excellent smartphone integration with compatibility for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, along with Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free calling and audio streaming. It is also SiriusXM-ready and has a built-in HD radio. There are camera and USB inputs along with an HDMI connection for a CD/DVD or Blu-ray player. Unfortunately, the camera inputs are compatible only with Alpine cameras, though a composite video adapter for connecting a non-Alpine camera is included. Sound performance is excellent with adjustability via a 13-band parametric equalizer and high- and low-pass filters, among other audio enhancements.</p>

<p>            The DMH-WC5700NEX is a modular car stereo featuring a 6.8-inch capacitive touchscreen and a single-DIN installation chassis. The tablet-like display features icon controls and is connected to the chassis via a cable that allows for versatile installation even in tight compartments.

                    The WC5700NEX has outstanding wired or wireless support for Apple CarPlay, allowing easy and safe hands-free access to your phone including your music library, messages, and your favorite apps. It is also compatible with Android Auto and Amazon Alexa. Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, HDMI, two camera inputs, and a rear AUX input. The built-in 50W x 4 amplifier provides plenty of power for the 13-band graphic equalizer to produce exceptional sound quality. If an iPhone is your smartphone of choice, the Pioneer DMH-WC5700NEX is one of the best when it comes to Apple CarPlay support.</p>

                                                            Affordable</p>
<p>                                            Cons</p>
<p>                                                            No support for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto<br />
                                                            Resistive touchscreen is not as smooth as capacitive options</p>
<p>            The KENWOOD Excelon DDX396BT is a double-DIN head unit with a 6.2-inch resistive touchscreen. Resistive touchscreens require firm taps and presses, so the inclusion of physical controls along the left side of the panel is a nice bonus. Connectivity includes USB and Bluetooth that supports Apple or Android smartphone connections and charging. However, it isn&#8217;t compatible with CarPlay or Android Auto.<br />
                    When it comes to audio streaming, the DDX396BT is capable of supporting five streaming devices simultaneously. The selling point, though, is its CD/DVD player for those who have held onto physical discs and supports a wide range of digital video and music formats. Sound quality is enhanced via a 13-band graphic equalizer and loudness control, among other settings. If you want to continue to enjoy your CDs on the road, the KENWOOD Excelon DDX396BT is the best available, putting digital and physical media at your fingertips.</p>

<p>            The JVC KW M56BT should be the go-to option for anyone looking for one of the best affordable car stereos. The M56BT is a double-DIN car stereo and features a customizable 6.8-inch capacitive touchscreen. Gesture control is a nice feature that brings easy volume and track control. The M56BT has top-notch sound performance thanks to the built-in amplifier and equalizer to back up its 50 watts of power per channel.<br />
                    Additional features that you would expect to find on much more expensive units include wired support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, hands-free calling via Bluetooth, and SiriusXM support. Also included are a backup camera input and steering wheel controls with an additional adapter. The JVC KW M56BT proves you don&#8217;t have to break the bank for a full-feature car stereo.</p>

                                                            SiriusXM requires separate tuner</p>
<p>            There are a few single-DIN car stereos with touchscreens, but if you&#8217;re lacking space on your dash, the JVC KD-T920BTS is a good option to consider. The KD-T920BTS has a detachable 2-Line Vertical Alignment LCD display for great visibility and information. The display also features a customizable 2-zone variable-color button and accent illumination. Not only does it play CDs, but it is also SiriusXM-ready (with an optional tuner), has a front AUX input, and has a USB port for music on a thumb drive.<br />
                    The KD-T920BTS also features Bluetooth for hands-free calling and audio streaming for iPhone and Android phones. The JVC Streaming DJ feature allows for streaming and playback control from up to five paired smartphones. Sound quality is formidable with a 13-band equalizer and JVC&#8217;s K2 technology that improves the sound of CDs and digital music files. A nice feature is Amazon Alexa compatibility which is activated via a dedicated button on the front panel. The JVC KD-T920BTS is a quality single-DIN option and one of the best.</p>
<p>            Which Is The Best Car Stereo?<br />
                   There are many factors that go into what will be considered the best car stereo for you. These include whether the unit will fit in your car, the type of smartphone you have, and what type of music source you use, among others.<br />
                    The Pioneer WT7600NEX is our top pick because it combines a wide array of features and outstanding performance to enhance your driving experience. It&#8217;s a great choice for anyone who wants seamless smartphone integration with a car stereo. And the best part is that even though it has a large touchscreen, which is normally seen with double-DIN units, the WT7600 fits in a single-DIN slot.<br />
                    Speaking of installation, the Alpine iLX-W650 is worth getting for its shallow chassis, making it a good choice for car dashes that don&#8217;t have much real estate. Easy installation aside, it also offers excellent smartphone integration. If you&#8217;re looking to save some money, the JVC KW M56BT is the one to get. A lower price doesn&#8217;t mean a lack of features, though. The KW M56BT checks all the boxes you&#8217;d expect from a more expensive car stereo, including smartphone integration, top-notch sound, and gesture controls.</p>

<p>            FAQs<br />
       Q: Is Apple CarPlay or Android Auto necessary if the car stereo has Bluetooth?            A: Bluetooth is not the same as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Bluetooth uses radio frequencies at short range to transfer data mainly for audio streaming and hands-free calling. Meanwhile, CarPlay and Android Auto offer more robust smartphone integration with easy access to a variety of apps for music streaming, messaging, navigation, and more. AC and AA can be connected to your car stereo either wired or wirelessly and are modeled in ways to safely utilize our smartphones while driving such as larger screens and the ability to use voice assistants (Siri and Google Assistant).<br />
        Q: How will I know if a car stereo will fit in my car? Double-DIN vs Singe-DIN.            A: Not all car stereos are compatible with all cars. There are primarily two form factors when it comes to car stereos, single and double-DIN. DIN stands for Deutsche Industrie Norm which is the standardized car stereo opening size for cars. This standard has two sizes, single-DIN, which is roughly two inches tall and 7 inches wide, and double-DIN, which is around four inches wide and seven inches tall.<br />
                    One of the main differences is that a double-DIN slot will let you install a stereo with a large display or touchscreen. However, there are an increasing number of car stereos with modular or floating screens which means you can have a large display even with a single-DIN unit.<br />
        Q: Do call car stereos play all music formats?            A: Modern car stereos offer many options when it comes to music playback. Most car stereos are compatible with digital formats like MP3, AAC, and WMA and will play those formats from a variety of sources. Digital music can be played via streaming, from a USB thumb drive, input to an AUX port, and more. While digital media is becoming the norm, some car stereos can still play CDs and even DVDs depending on the unit.</p>
