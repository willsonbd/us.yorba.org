A new teaser trailer for <a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/mission-impossible-7/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One</a> offers a closer look at a train stunt Tom Cruise does in the movie. Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One will be the first of a two-part finale for Cruise&#8217;s Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The film releases in theaters on July 12, 2023, with promises of plenty of action to kickstart the end of Ethan&#8217;s missions for the IMF.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://twitter.com/MissionFilm/status/1666159103872487424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mission: Impossible</a> Twitter page has released a new teaser for <a href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-7-release-date-cast-story-details/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One</a>.<br />
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</p>
<p>The short trailer shows off the many action sequences of the film, including a closer look at Cruise hanging onto a train. The end of the trailer sees Cruise&#8217;s face pressed against the top of the train, in what is no doubt another impressive stunt in the film.</p>
<p> The Many Impressive Stunts Of Mission: Impossible 7 </p>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s train stunt is one of many impressive action sequences that will be featured in Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One. One of <a href="https://screenrant.com/mission-imposible-7-tom-cruise-stunt-risk-motorcycle/">Cruise&#8217;s death-defying Mission: Impossible 7 stunts</a> is when he rides a motorcycle off a cliff, jumping off it midair, and falling to the ground below. This stunt was done practically by Cruise, showcasing his dedication to making Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One as authentic an action movie experience as possible.</p>
<p>However, that doesn&#8217;t mean the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible series hasn&#8217;t seen its fair share of difficulties. Production on the film began in February 2020, shutting down only a month later due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The film is also facing some theatrical difficulties as well, with reporting indicating <a href="https://screenrant.com/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-7-barbie-oppenheimer-imax-screens/">Cruise is angry at Oppenheimer and Barbie</a> for taking screens, such as IMAX screens, away from Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One.</p>
<p>Despite the number of challenges the latest Mission: Impossible has faced, it&#8217;s clear Cruise has given his two-part finale all of his dedication, which will no doubt translate into an exciting film. The closer look at his train stunt in the movie underscores just how intense and thrilling the finale of Mission: Impossible will be. It remains to be seen if the final movie, which comes out in 2024, can compare to the excitement promised in Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning: Part One.</p>
