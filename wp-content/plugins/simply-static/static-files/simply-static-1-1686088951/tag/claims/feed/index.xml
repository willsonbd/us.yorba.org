The drama surrounding who called the FBI on <a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey/">The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>&#8216;s Joe and Teresa Giudice continues, as the former is putting blame on Melissa and Joe Gorga for the whole ordeal. The speculation started up again recently when <a href="https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-13-reunion-trailer/">Teresa made the bold accusation</a> during the RHONJ season 13 reunion that Melissa turned her and her then-husband in. The now-former couple was sent to prison&#8211;over three years for Joe Giudice and less than one year for Teresa&#8211;for tax and bank fraud, among other charges. They ended up serving their respective sentences at separate times so that one of the parents could always be with their children.<br />
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</p>
<p>Teresa and Joe Giudice&#8217;s prison sentences are well behind them now, but the drama surrounding how they got there hasn&#8217;t ended. Following Teresa&#8217;s recent comments at the RHONJ season 13 reunion, Joe Giudice echoed those claims while appearing on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/juicy-joe-giudice-on-rhonj-past-present-who-called/id1496557812?i=1000615693123" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Behind The Velvet Rope</a> podcast. &#8220;I think Melissa and Joe were involved&#8221; in alerting the FBI. He noted that <a href="https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-new-jersey-melissa-joe-gorga-relationship/">RHONJ&#8217;s Melissa and Joe Gorga</a> were apparently &#8220;good friends&#8221; with his &#8220;ex-partner&#8217;s attorneys, which went to the feds.&#8221;</p>
<p> Joe Giudice Claims Former FBI Agent Told Him About Melissa &amp; Joe Gorga </p>
<p>This alone is a giant accusation to make, but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsXjYcmgKIo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joe Giudice</a> also alleged that he was told this information from a man who used to work at the FBI. This is why he believes the Gorgas turning them in is a &#8220;fact.&#8221; He concluded, &#8220;[Melissa and Joe] went to the feds to feed them all this information. Yeah, I might&#8217;ve cheated on some things, my tax returns, who didn&#8217;t?&#8221; During the same podcast discussion, Joe Giudice continuously slammed Melissa and Joe Gorga and claimed that they should be thanking him since they got paid for a RHONJ spin-off called Teresa Checks In, which revolved around Teresa&#8217;s time behind bars.</p>
<p>Aside from the blame game at the heart of this accusation, it appears that Joe Giudice believes someone turning him in to the FBI is worse than the actual crime he committed. By saying, &#8220;Who didn&#8217;t?&#8221; he&#8217;s dismissing his tax fraud by insinuating lots of other people do it, so it&#8217;s, therefore, not a big deal to him. Considering this matter involves breaking the law, it definitely is a big deal. Obviously, he would love to know who turned him in since it affects him and his whole family. But caring more about the informants than feeling remorse for the crimes that were committed isn&#8217;t a great position to have.</p>

<p>The feud between Teresa and the Gorgas is clearly not ending anytime soon. If anything, the recent RHONJ season 13 reunion and Joe Giudice&#8217;s podcast comments proved that things are ramping up even more. Caroline Manzo recently claimed she knows who called the FBI on the Giudices but refused to divulge any names, so it&#8217;s left up to those at the center of the scandal to try to fill in the gaps with various allegations, regardless of whether they&#8217;re true or not. It&#8217;s not surprising they&#8217;re putting the blame on the Gorgas, but it&#8217;s unclear if the absolute truth will ever come out to either support or refute these allegations.</p>
<p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on Bravo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Despite rampant speculation suggesting otherwise, Kyrie Irving is apparently content to re-sign with the Dallas Mavericks. Kyrie Irving has been tied to LeBron James and the <a href="https://fansided.com/nba/nba-teams/los-angeles-lakers/">Los Angeles Lakers</a> since before the trade deadline last season. The disgruntled star was traded from Brooklyn to Dallas in the final year of an expiring contract and, to add fuel to the fire of speculation, the <a href="https://fansided.com/nba/nba-teams/dallas-mavericks/">Mavs</a> missed the playoffs despite a statistically fruitful partnership between Kyrie and Luka Doncic.Irving then went on to attend multiple Lakers playoff games, leading some to believe he was angling to get in the good graces of LeBron and the Lakers’ front office. Irving famously demanded a trade away from LeBron in Cleveland but has since seen the error in his ways.<a href="https://marcstein.substack.com/p/lebron-and-the-mavericks?r=o66it&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New reporting from NBA insider Marc Stein</a>, however, paints a different picture of Irving’s upcoming free agency.Kyrie Irving wants to re-sign with the Dallas Mavericks“Two sources close to the process insisted Monday that Irving has consistently expressed a desire to remain a Maverick and actually wants to shut down the notion that he’s angling to get to L.A.”That kind of sentiment will come as a surprise to many, especially those among the LA faithful who were hoping for Kyrie to push the Lakers over the finish line. That said, the Mavs have every financial advantage to keep Irving. Meanwhile, the Lakers are not interested in the idea of reuniting LeBron with his former co-champion, <a href="https://theathletic.com/4582508/2023/06/05/kyrie-lebron-mavericks-lakers/?source=emp_shared_article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to Jovan Buha of The Athletic</a>.This feels like a perfect storm of those two facts: Irving can get the most money from Dallas and the Lakers don’t want him or the headache he traditionally brings with him. Irving probably enjoys playing with Luka Doncic too. Just because last season ended poorly doesn’t mean 2023-24 will end the same way.Irving and Doncic form arguably the most skilled, potent guard duo in the NBA. Irving is <a href="https://fansided.com/2023/06/05/kyrie-irving-lebron-trade-twitter/">openly recruiting LeBron to Dallas</a>, to really drive home his desire to stick around. The logistics of that hypothetical transaction are <a href="https://fansided.com/2023/06/06/5-assets-mavericks-acquire-lebron-james/">borderline unfathomable</a>, but hey — it’s a nice thought.Irving and LeBron have progressed past the conflict that once mired their relationship and Irving evidently has a place where he’s happy playing basketball. This feels like a win all around. Don’t expect Irving and James to team up any time soon, but get excited for the next year-plus of Irving and Luka dancing on hapless defenders. </p>
