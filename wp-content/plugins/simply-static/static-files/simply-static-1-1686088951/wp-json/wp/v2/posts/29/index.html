With a strong option under center, the Jets have huge aspirations heading into the season. But Jets fans wondered when the good vibes would end. Well, there was a pause on May 24 when Rodgers strained his calf. Since Rodgers had been limited during organized team activities.On Tuesday, Jets head coach Robert Saleh revealed that Rodgers will do everything in practice besides participate in 11-on-11 drills. The reason behind it, per Saleh, is that they didn\u2019t want any other player near Rodgers\u2019 legs.Robert Saleh says Aaron Rodgers will do everything today except for 11-on-11. The <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Jets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Jets<\/a> don\u2019t want anyone by his legs.\u2014 Connor Hughes (@Connor_J_Hughes) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Connor_J_Hughes\/status\/1666094145012899840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2023<\/a>Aaron Rodgers active in June 6 workouts, but did not participate in 11-on-11 drillsYes, it\u2019s organized team activities, but hearing that Rodgers is progressing from his calf injury has to be great news for them. However, they just want to hear that he will be good to go for the start of the regular season, in which they face the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football.The Jets have just two more practices for organized team activities on June 8 and 9. The team was supposed to have mandatory minicamp from June 13-15, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sny.tv\/articles\/robert-saleh-why-jets-won-t-be-holding-mandatory-minicamp-2023\">Saleh announced that they were canceled<\/a>. The reasoning behind the decision is that the Jets are starting training camp a week earlier than other teams because they will be participating in this year\u2019s Hall of Fame Game.No official start date for training camp has been announced as of this writing.Rodgers is coming off of a 2022 season in which he threw for 3,695 yards, 26 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions while completing 64.6 percent of his passes.This upcoming season, he will have some familiar faces to target like Allen Lazard and Randall Cobb, and some new faces like Garrett Wilson and Mecole Hardman. Fans will continue to follow updates in the final two days of OTAs. <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><br \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers was active at Tuesday\u2019s offseason workouts, but the team won\u2019t let him participate in one drill in particular.The New York Jets were feeling good after the&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":30,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[6,10,8,11,7,12,9],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.8 -
