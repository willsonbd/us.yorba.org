										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CarStereo1.jpg" /><br />            Car stereos have come a long way from static-y AM radio to the infotainment hubs they are today. Car stereos have become one of the more important options to consider when purchasing a car or upgrading the existing setup in your vehicle. Smartphone integration is also a key factor, and with that evolution, car stereos have become more than just something that plays tunes while driving.<br />

                    No longer just a mere accessory, car stereos must play and stream music in different formats, connect to our smartphones, navigate for us, and even play videos (while the car is parked). Some new vehicles have stereos that meet the needs of today’s drivers, but what about those situations where you are looking to replace a broken or upgrade an outdated car stereo? The choices are numerous and varied, just as with any other on-the-go infotainment needs. There are many things to consider when selecting a car stereo, and these are some of the best car stereos available.</p>

                                                            Expensive<br />

<p>            The Alpine Halo11 iLX511 features the best touchscreen you can find on a car stereo. Measuring a gigantic 11-inch, the screen is floating with adjustability for height, depth, and viewing angle. The display resolution is eye-catching and crisp at 1280 x 720 pixels and is also very responsive. However, despite the size of the touchscreen, the iLX511 fits most single-DIN openings.<br />
                    More than just a pretty face, the iLX511 has excellent smartphone integration with compatibility for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, along with Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free calling and audio streaming. It is also SiriusXM-ready and has a built-in HD radio. There are camera and USB inputs along with an HDMI connection for a CD/DVD or Blu-ray player. Unfortunately, the camera inputs are compatible only with Alpine cameras, though a composite video adapter for connecting a non-Alpine camera is included. Sound performance is excellent with adjustability via a 13-band parametric equalizer and high- and low-pass filters, among other audio enhancements.</p>

<p>            The DMH-WC5700NEX is a modular car stereo featuring a 6.8-inch capacitive touchscreen and a single-DIN installation chassis. The tablet-like display features icon controls and is connected to the chassis via a cable that allows for versatile installation even in tight compartments.

                    The WC5700NEX has outstanding wired or wireless support for Apple CarPlay, allowing easy and safe hands-free access to your phone including your music library, messages, and your favorite apps. It is also compatible with Android Auto and Amazon Alexa. Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, HDMI, two camera inputs, and a rear AUX input. The built-in 50W x 4 amplifier provides plenty of power for the 13-band graphic equalizer to produce exceptional sound quality. If an iPhone is your smartphone of choice, the Pioneer DMH-WC5700NEX is one of the best when it comes to Apple CarPlay support.</p>

                                                            Affordable</p>
<p>                                            Cons</p>
<p>                                                            No support for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto<br />
                                                            Resistive touchscreen is not as smooth as capacitive options</p>
<p>            The KENWOOD Excelon DDX396BT is a double-DIN head unit with a 6.2-inch resistive touchscreen. Resistive touchscreens require firm taps and presses, so the inclusion of physical controls along the left side of the panel is a nice bonus. Connectivity includes USB and Bluetooth that supports Apple or Android smartphone connections and charging. However, it isn&#8217;t compatible with CarPlay or Android Auto.<br />
                    When it comes to audio streaming, the DDX396BT is capable of supporting five streaming devices simultaneously. The selling point, though, is its CD/DVD player for those who have held onto physical discs and supports a wide range of digital video and music formats. Sound quality is enhanced via a 13-band graphic equalizer and loudness control, among other settings. If you want to continue to enjoy your CDs on the road, the KENWOOD Excelon DDX396BT is the best available, putting digital and physical media at your fingertips.</p>

<p>            The JVC KW M56BT should be the go-to option for anyone looking for one of the best affordable car stereos. The M56BT is a double-DIN car stereo and features a customizable 6.8-inch capacitive touchscreen. Gesture control is a nice feature that brings easy volume and track control. The M56BT has top-notch sound performance thanks to the built-in amplifier and equalizer to back up its 50 watts of power per channel.<br />
                    Additional features that you would expect to find on much more expensive units include wired support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, hands-free calling via Bluetooth, and SiriusXM support. Also included are a backup camera input and steering wheel controls with an additional adapter. The JVC KW M56BT proves you don&#8217;t have to break the bank for a full-feature car stereo.</p>

<p>                    Best Single-DIN Car Stereo</p>
<p>                    The JVC KD-T920BTS is one of the best single-DIN car stereos available. It features Bluetooth and Amazon Alexa.</p>

                                                            SiriusXM requires separate tuner</p>
<p>            There are a few single-DIN car stereos with touchscreens, but if you&#8217;re lacking space on your dash, the JVC KD-T920BTS is a good option to consider. The KD-T920BTS has a detachable 2-Line Vertical Alignment LCD display for great visibility and information. The display also features a customizable 2-zone variable-color button and accent illumination. Not only does it play CDs, but it is also SiriusXM-ready (with an optional tuner), has a front AUX input, and has a USB port for music on a thumb drive.<br />
                    The KD-T920BTS also features Bluetooth for hands-free calling and audio streaming for iPhone and Android phones. The JVC Streaming DJ feature allows for streaming and playback control from up to five paired smartphones. Sound quality is formidable with a 13-band equalizer and JVC&#8217;s K2 technology that improves the sound of CDs and digital music files. A nice feature is Amazon Alexa compatibility which is activated via a dedicated button on the front panel. The JVC KD-T920BTS is a quality single-DIN option and one of the best.</p>
<p>            Which Is The Best Car Stereo?<br />
                   There are many factors that go into what will be considered the best car stereo for you. These include whether the unit will fit in your car, the type of smartphone you have, and what type of music source you use, among others.<br />
                    The Pioneer WT7600NEX is our top pick because it combines a wide array of features and outstanding performance to enhance your driving experience. It&#8217;s a great choice for anyone who wants seamless smartphone integration with a car stereo. And the best part is that even though it has a large touchscreen, which is normally seen with double-DIN units, the WT7600 fits in a single-DIN slot.<br />
                    Speaking of installation, the Alpine iLX-W650 is worth getting for its shallow chassis, making it a good choice for car dashes that don&#8217;t have much real estate. Easy installation aside, it also offers excellent smartphone integration. If you&#8217;re looking to save some money, the JVC KW M56BT is the one to get. A lower price doesn&#8217;t mean a lack of features, though. The KW M56BT checks all the boxes you&#8217;d expect from a more expensive car stereo, including smartphone integration, top-notch sound, and gesture controls.</p>

<p>                    Best Overall</p>

                                                            Pricey</p>
<p>            FAQs<br />
       Q: Is Apple CarPlay or Android Auto necessary if the car stereo has Bluetooth?            A: Bluetooth is not the same as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Bluetooth uses radio frequencies at short range to transfer data mainly for audio streaming and hands-free calling. Meanwhile, CarPlay and Android Auto offer more robust smartphone integration with easy access to a variety of apps for music streaming, messaging, navigation, and more. AC and AA can be connected to your car stereo either wired or wirelessly and are modeled in ways to safely utilize our smartphones while driving such as larger screens and the ability to use voice assistants (Siri and Google Assistant).<br />
        Q: How will I know if a car stereo will fit in my car? Double-DIN vs Singe-DIN.            A: Not all car stereos are compatible with all cars. There are primarily two form factors when it comes to car stereos, single and double-DIN. DIN stands for Deutsche Industrie Norm which is the standardized car stereo opening size for cars. This standard has two sizes, single-DIN, which is roughly two inches tall and 7 inches wide, and double-DIN, which is around four inches wide and seven inches tall.<br />
                    One of the main differences is that a double-DIN slot will let you install a stereo with a large display or touchscreen. However, there are an increasing number of car stereos with modular or floating screens which means you can have a large display even with a single-DIN unit.<br />
        Q: Do call car stereos play all music formats?            A: Modern car stereos offer many options when it comes to music playback. Most car stereos are compatible with digital formats like MP3, AAC, and WMA and will play those formats from a variety of sources. Digital music can be played via streaming, from a USB thumb drive, input to an AUX port, and more. While digital media is becoming the norm, some car stereos can still play CDs and even DVDs depending on the unit.</p>

A new teaser trailer for <a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/mission-impossible-7/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One</a> offers a closer look at a train stunt Tom Cruise does in the movie. Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One will be the first of a two-part finale for Cruise&#8217;s Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The film releases in theaters on July 12, 2023, with promises of plenty of action to kickstart the end of Ethan&#8217;s missions for the IMF.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://twitter.com/MissionFilm/status/1666159103872487424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mission: Impossible</a> Twitter page has released a new teaser for <a href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-7-release-date-cast-story-details/">Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One</a>.<br />
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</p>
<p>The short trailer shows off the many action sequences of the film, including a closer look at Cruise hanging onto a train. The end of the trailer sees Cruise&#8217;s face pressed against the top of the train, in what is no doubt another impressive stunt in the film.</p>
<p> The Many Impressive Stunts Of Mission: Impossible 7 </p>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s train stunt is one of many impressive action sequences that will be featured in Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One. One of <a href="https://screenrant.com/mission-imposible-7-tom-cruise-stunt-risk-motorcycle/">Cruise&#8217;s death-defying Mission: Impossible 7 stunts</a> is when he rides a motorcycle off a cliff, jumping off it midair, and falling to the ground below. This stunt was done practically by Cruise, showcasing his dedication to making Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One as authentic an action movie experience as possible.</p>
<p>However, that doesn&#8217;t mean the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible series hasn&#8217;t seen its fair share of difficulties. Production on the film began in February 2020, shutting down only a month later due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The film is also facing some theatrical difficulties as well, with reporting indicating <a href="https://screenrant.com/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-7-barbie-oppenheimer-imax-screens/">Cruise is angry at Oppenheimer and Barbie</a> for taking screens, such as IMAX screens, away from Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One.</p>
<p>Despite the number of challenges the latest Mission: Impossible has faced, it&#8217;s clear Cruise has given his two-part finale all of his dedication, which will no doubt translate into an exciting film. The closer look at his train stunt in the movie underscores just how intense and thrilling the finale of Mission: Impossible will be. It remains to be seen if the final movie, which comes out in 2024, can compare to the excitement promised in Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning: Part One.</p>

A vitally important and visually stunning new graphic novel, Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, adapts MacArthur Genius Grant winner Dr. Ibram X. Kendi&#8217;s 2016 book of the same name. This new medium makes Kendi&#8217;s acclaimed history book more accessible and digestible to a variety of readers.</p>
<p>Kendi is a National Book Award-winning historian and the founder and director of Boston University&#8217;s Center for Antiracist Research. He worked closely with award-winning cartoonist and historian Joel Christian Gill to adapt Stamped from the Beginning into the graphic novel format. Their collaboration gives the critically necessary text new life in 2023 amidst continued violence against Black and Brown bodies across the United States.<br />
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</p>
<p>Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America is an impressive and disturbing weaving of the United States&#8217; horrifically racist roots, the institutional and interpersonal racism still pervasive in American society today, and the ways in which antiracist movements can inspire hope and change. These important lessons are all wrapped up in truly gorgeous and evocative art by Joel Christian Gill for the new graphic novel format.</p>
<p>Racism has persisted throughout history—but so have antiracist efforts to dismantle it. Through deep research and a gripping narrative that illuminates the lives of five key American figures, preeminent historian Ibram X. Kendi reveals how understanding and improving the world cannot happen without identifying and facing the racist forces that shape it.</p>

<p>Kendi argues that &#8220;&#8230;the root of these tragedies&#8230; is a lineage of racist ideas that have endured and continue to be reproduced throughout the history and present of the United States, ideas that continually justify racist policies.&#8221; This new graphic novel was adapted beginning in 2020 amidst protests caused by the murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Jacob Blake <a href="https://screenrant.com/do-right-thing-george-floyd-protest-video-spike-lee/">and George Floyd</a>. It aims to make complex ideas about race and racism, and the history of how racism has shaped and continues to guide the United States, very digestible to a variety of readers who may have little exposure to this topic. This adaptation is incredibly important because the more people who gain access to the critically important writings of Kendi, the more the public can understand the impact of conservative politicians&#8217; battles against things like <a href="https://screenrant.com/keeping-up-kardashians-caitlyn-jenner-race-schools-politics/">Critical Race Theory being taught in schools</a>.</p>
<p>Stamped from the Beginning shows that unfiltered history, truth, accountability, and pursuit of justice are the critical components of building an antiracist culture and future, ideals that are being destroyed by recent movements towards book banning and resegregation. The new graphic novel adaptation is a vast and decades spanning history of how racist ideas first rooted in America. It is grounded in the exploration of five key American figures who have impacted the development and change of the United States since its founding: Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Angela Davis. Stamped from the Beginning made a major splash in the world of politics, education, and antiracist activism when it first debuted in 2016. Now the &#8220;culture defining&#8221; text is even more necessary than ever, making the graphic novel adaptation&#8217;s accessibility to younger readers and those unfamiliar with its concepts and histories even more critical.</p>
<p>Kendi&#8217;s book was a critical and imperative text when it first debuted in 2016. This stunning new graphic novel adaptation of Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America comes at a time when racial justice and antiracist activism is facing more pushback than has been seen in years, making its approachability and illustrated breakdowns of racist ideas and their impact more important than ever.</p>
<p>Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America is available now.</p>

The drama surrounding who called the FBI on <a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey/">The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>&#8216;s Joe and Teresa Giudice continues, as the former is putting blame on Melissa and Joe Gorga for the whole ordeal. The speculation started up again recently when <a href="https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-13-reunion-trailer/">Teresa made the bold accusation</a> during the RHONJ season 13 reunion that Melissa turned her and her then-husband in. The now-former couple was sent to prison&#8211;over three years for Joe Giudice and less than one year for Teresa&#8211;for tax and bank fraud, among other charges. They ended up serving their respective sentences at separate times so that one of the parents could always be with their children.<br />
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</p>
<p>Teresa and Joe Giudice&#8217;s prison sentences are well behind them now, but the drama surrounding how they got there hasn&#8217;t ended. Following Teresa&#8217;s recent comments at the RHONJ season 13 reunion, Joe Giudice echoed those claims while appearing on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/juicy-joe-giudice-on-rhonj-past-present-who-called/id1496557812?i=1000615693123" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Behind The Velvet Rope</a> podcast. &#8220;I think Melissa and Joe were involved&#8221; in alerting the FBI. He noted that <a href="https://screenrant.com/real-housewives-new-jersey-melissa-joe-gorga-relationship/">RHONJ&#8217;s Melissa and Joe Gorga</a> were apparently &#8220;good friends&#8221; with his &#8220;ex-partner&#8217;s attorneys, which went to the feds.&#8221;</p>
<p> Joe Giudice Claims Former FBI Agent Told Him About Melissa &amp; Joe Gorga </p>
<p>This alone is a giant accusation to make, but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsXjYcmgKIo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joe Giudice</a> also alleged that he was told this information from a man who used to work at the FBI. This is why he believes the Gorgas turning them in is a &#8220;fact.&#8221; He concluded, &#8220;[Melissa and Joe] went to the feds to feed them all this information. Yeah, I might&#8217;ve cheated on some things, my tax returns, who didn&#8217;t?&#8221; During the same podcast discussion, Joe Giudice continuously slammed Melissa and Joe Gorga and claimed that they should be thanking him since they got paid for a RHONJ spin-off called Teresa Checks In, which revolved around Teresa&#8217;s time behind bars.</p>
<p>Aside from the blame game at the heart of this accusation, it appears that Joe Giudice believes someone turning him in to the FBI is worse than the actual crime he committed. By saying, &#8220;Who didn&#8217;t?&#8221; he&#8217;s dismissing his tax fraud by insinuating lots of other people do it, so it&#8217;s, therefore, not a big deal to him. Considering this matter involves breaking the law, it definitely is a big deal. Obviously, he would love to know who turned him in since it affects him and his whole family. But caring more about the informants than feeling remorse for the crimes that were committed isn&#8217;t a great position to have.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="https://screenrant.com/rhonj-all-times-joe-gorga-fought-joe-giudice/">RHONJ: All The Times Joe Gorga Has Fought With Joe Giudice</a></p>
<p>The feud between Teresa and the Gorgas is clearly not ending anytime soon. If anything, the recent RHONJ season 13 reunion and Joe Giudice&#8217;s podcast comments proved that things are ramping up even more. Caroline Manzo recently claimed she knows who called the FBI on the Giudices but refused to divulge any names, so it&#8217;s left up to those at the center of the scandal to try to fill in the gaps with various allegations, regardless of whether they&#8217;re true or not. It&#8217;s not surprising they&#8217;re putting the blame on the Gorgas, but it&#8217;s unclear if the absolute truth will ever come out to either support or refute these allegations.</p>
<p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on Bravo.</p>

<p>Warning: The following article contains spoilers from Cruel Summer season 2, episodes 1 and 2.<a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/cruel-summer/">Cruel Summer</a> is more mysterious than ever as season 2 introduces fans to an entirely new cast of characters who bring with them numerous secrets. The Freeform anthology series&#8217; second season revolves around the different stages of two teenage girls&#8217; friendship and how it all culminates in a disappearance and a murder. Episode 1 wanted viewers to believe that Isabella LaRue, one of the two protagonists, was the missing person in the small town of Chatham when, in reality, the mystery was much more complicated.</p>
<p>As season 2 continues, fans will gradually learn more about why the aforementioned character went missing and the details of their murder. But for now, viewers can use the twist and turns of the first two episodes to try to piece together the story of what happened in Chatham in the summer of 1999, winter of 1999, and summer of 2000. However, based on the <a href="https://screenrant.com/cruel-summer-season-2-gets-premiere-update/">Cruel Summer season 2 premiere</a>, nothing is what it seems.</p>
<p>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</p>

<p> 8  Police Find Luke&#8217;s Body In The Water In Cruel Summer Season 2 </p>
<p>As it turns out, Isabella wasn&#8217;t the one who went missing in Cruel Summer season 2 — it was Luke Chambers, Megan Landry&#8217;s boyfriend. At the end of episode 1, the police discovered a body in the water in the summer of 2000, and when they pulled it out, a small crowd gathered at the scene, including Megan. As Sheriff Dyer and other cops rolled the bagged body onto land, Steve Chambers, Luke&#8217;s father, ignored the crime scene tape and ran up to the stretcher. He unzipped the bag and heartbreakingly revealed it was Luke&#8217;s dead body inside. Following the ordeal, Isabella strolled up beside Megan and told her former best friend, &#8220;We have to get our story straight.&#8221;<br />
Since Cruel Summer season 2, episode 1 intentionally led the audience to believe that Isabella was the one who went missing, learning that it was actually Luke was shocking, to say the least. Episode 2 gave more information about his disappearance, including that it happened around the end of 1999. Luke was last seen leaving a New Year&#8217;s Eve party with Megan, and it was at that same party that people saw Isabella and Megan fighting. So while it&#8217;s still unclear what happened to Luke that night, Cruel Summer fans at least know that he&#8217;s been missing for more than six months.Related: <a href="https://screenrant.com/cruel-summer-show-bert-royal-exit-why-details/">Cruel Summer Creator No Longer Involved With the Show</a></p>
<p> 7  Luke Was Murdered </p>
<p>After the police department and the medical examiner&#8217;s office pulled Luke&#8217;s body out of the water in the Cruel Summer season 2 premiere, an autopsy revealed that Luke&#8217;s death wasn&#8217;t accidental. His cause of death was drowning, but an abrasion on his ear suggested that someone had shot a gun at him, and the bullet nicked his ear. Plus, Luke&#8217;s toxicology report revealed that he had an excessive amount of benzodiazepine, a muscle relaxant, in his system when he died. So whoever killed him wanted to ensure he went into the water without a fight.<br />
The autopsy report suggested that someone had planned Luke&#8217;s murder, so it wasn&#8217;t a spur-of-the-moment decision on the killer&#8217;s part. The police don&#8217;t have any viable suspects yet. But after watching the first two episodes of Cruel Summer season 2, it&#8217;s obvious that two characters know more about Luke&#8217;s death than they are letting on.</p>
<p> 6  Megan &amp; Isabella Know Something About Luke&#8217;s Murder </p>
<p>The more time Cruel Summer season 2 spends in the summer of 2000, the more guilty Megan and Isabella look. In episode 1, Megan snuck out of her house to meet with a suspicious man, who she accused of talking to the police and gave a floppy disk to in exchange for cash. When Megan stopped by Luke&#8217;s missing person poster, Parker Tanaka approached her and said, &#8220;None of this would&#8217;ve happened if she never came to town.&#8221; Later, Megan went to the cabin where she and Luke used to hang out and scrubbed a copious amount of blood off the floor. Then, as mentioned previously, Isabella told Megan they needed to get their story straight at the end of the premiere.<br />
In episode 2, viewers learned that Isabella and Megan had a falling out of sorts before the summer, and it likely has to do with Luke&#8217;s disappearance and murder. When Isabella informed Megan that she planned on leaving town after Luke&#8217;s body was found, Megan was livid. She couldn&#8217;t believe that Isabella would let her take all the &#8220;blame.&#8221; So, Megan coerced Isabella into staying by promising to &#8220;keep her mouth shut&#8221; if she did. Later, Isabella was very defensive during her interview with Sheriff Myer, and she flushed some pills down the toilet afterward. So it&#8217;s possible that either Megan and Isabella are the ones who killed Luke in Cruel Summer season 2, or they know who did.</p>
<p> 5  Megan Is The Girl In The Sex Tape, Not Isabella </p>
<p>At the end of Cruel Summer season 2, episode 1, a sex tape involving Luke and a girl whose face couldn&#8217;t be seen played at the Chambers&#8217; holiday party in the winter of 1999. Because Isabella&#8217;s sweater could be made out in the video, everyone pointed their fingers at her. Luke quickly stopped the video, and Megan snatched it from him and ran out of the party. However, during episode 2, the audience discovered that it was Megan in the sex tape with Luke, not Isabella.<br />
Unfortunately for Luke and Isabella, they had to keep up appearances that it was them two in the video in Cruel Summer. If word got out that it was Megan, she could have lost her scholarship to the University of Washington. Whereas Luke didn&#8217;t face any real consequences for his actions, the principal put Isabella on probation, which goes to show society&#8217;s double standards. The sex tape scandal occurred right before Luke went missing, so it&#8217;s likely that it has something to do with his murder, which, again, makes Megan and Isabella look even more guilty.<br />

<p> 4  Debbie &amp; Steve Are Dating In Cruel Summer </p>
<p>The summer of 1999 timeline in the Cruel Summer season 2 premiere revealed that Debbie Landry and Steve Chambers worked together at his business firm. It&#8217;s unclear whether their relationship was something more at that point, but by the winter of 1999, Debbie and Steve had begun dating. Since their kids have known each other almost their whole lives, it stands to reason that Debbie and Steve&#8217;s history runs deep. However, all fans know is that Steve&#8217;s wife died an unspecified amount of time ago, and it&#8217;s unclear what happened to Megan and Lily&#8217;s father.<br />
After Luke was found dead in the summer of 2000, Debbie was by Steve&#8217;s side, suggesting they are still together. But that might change once the truth surrounding Luke&#8217;s murder unravels. Megan knows something about what happened the night that Steve&#8217;s son disappeared, and it could just tear Debbie and Steve apart in <a href="https://screenrant.com/cruel-summer-season-2-trailer/">Cruel Summer season 2</a>.</p>
<p> 3  Debbie Gets Sick In The Winter Of 1999 </p>
<p>Aside from Luke&#8217;s death, the Cruel Summer season 2 premiere featured another sad development — Debbie is sick. The two episodes dropped subtle hints that Debbie&#8217;s health was deteriorating when Megan worried about paying bills and when she picked up medication for her mother at the local pharmacy. But Isabella&#8217;s interrogation at the police station revealed the most information surrounding Debbie&#8217;s illness.<br />
Sheriff Myer questioned Isabella about her intention to leave Chatham after Luke went missing in the winter of 1999. She decided to stay, and the sheriff was wondering why that was. Isabella informed him that she remained in the small town because Debbie got sick, and she wanted to help as much as she could. Cruel Summer has yet to disclose Debbie&#8217;s illness, whether it&#8217;s cancer or some other life-threatening disease. All that viewers know is that it&#8217;s serious, and they should be very worried about Debbie as season 2 continues.</p>
<p> 2  Isabella Seemingly Betrays Megan </p>
<p>When Cruel Summer season 2 began, Megan and Isabella didn&#8217;t immediately hit it off. But by the winter of 1999, the two teenagers were inseparable and formed a bond that one might interpret as unhealthy. Megan and Isabella were each other&#8217;s &#8220;ride or dies,&#8221; and Isabella claimed that Megan was &#8220;the most important person in this world&#8221; to her. But their codependency ran deep.<br />
After Isabella took the fall for Megan&#8217;s sex tape, she overheard Megan telling Luke that he was &#8220;the most important person in the world&#8221; to her, and she called him her &#8220;ride or die.&#8221; Hearing Megan use her words to describe Luke made Isabella furious. She stormed down the stairs and told Debbie, &#8220;There&#8217;s something you need to know.&#8221; Unfortunately, the hour cuts the scene off after her one line, so viewers don&#8217;t yet know what Isabella wanted to tell Debbie. But given context clues, it&#8217;s possible that Isabella was about to tell Debbie that Megan was the girl in the sex tape, not her. Only time will tell if Isabella betrayed her best friend in Cruel Summer season 2.Related: <a href="https://screenrant.com/cruel-summer-main-characters-ranked-least-to-most-likely-to-win-the-squid-game/">Cruel Summer Main Characters Ranked Least To Most Likely To Win The Squid Game</a></p>
<p> 1  Isabella&#8217;s Past Isn&#8217;t What It Seems in Cruel Summer Season 2 </p>
<p>Cruel Summer season 2 introduced Isabella as a well-traveled free spirit looking to experience a normal life for her senior year of high school. But after the two episodes came to an end, it was clear that there was more to Isabella than meets the eye. When Megan searched through her new roommate&#8217;s things, she discovered a floppy disk titled &#8220;Summer 1998,&#8221; which will undoubtedly reappear later on in the season. Elsewhere in the premiere, Megan found a Californian license with Isabella&#8217;s picture, but the name on it was Pat Highsmith. Either the license is a fake ID or it&#8217;s Isabella&#8217;s true identity.<br />
In episode 2, Sheriff Myer questioned Isabella about how she jumped between three schools in three years and suggested that trouble followed her wherever she went. Whatever the case, Isabella isn&#8217;t being truthful about her past. As Cruel Summer season 2 continues, all will be revealed regarding who Isabella is and what happened to her before she arrived in Chatham.</p>

<a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/the-lincoln-lawyer/">The Lincoln Lawyer</a> season 2 announces a release schedule and unveils new images. Based on the book series of the same name by Michael Connelly, which was previously adapted into the 2011 movie staring Matthew McConaughey, the Netflix legal drama follows Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Mickey Haller, a criminal-defense lawyer who works out of his titular vehicle rather than a traditional office. <a href="https://screenrant.com/lincoln-lawyer-show-cast-characters-book-explained/">The Lincoln Lawyer cast</a> also includes Neve Campbell, Becki Newton, Jazz Raycole, Angus Sampson, and Christopher Gorham.<br />
SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</p>
<p>Today, Netflix (via <a href="https://tvline.com/2023/06/06/lincoln-lawyer-season-2-release-date-photos-netflix/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TVLine</a>) unveiled first-look photos for <a href="https://screenrant.com/lincoln-lawyer-season-2-updates-story-news/">The Lincoln Lawyer season 2</a>. The images show Mickey alongside his first ex-wife and Deputy District Attorney Maggie (played by Campbell) and two new characters – a prosecutor named Andrea Freeman (Yaya DaCosta) and Lisa Trammell (Lana Parrilla), a chef accused of murdering a real estate developer. Mickey&#8217;s personal driver Izzy Letts (Jazz Raycole) and second ex-wife and legal aid Lorna Crane (Becki Newton) are also showcased. Check out the images below:</p>
<p>In addition to the first-look photos, a release schedule was also announced. The Lincoln Lawyer season 2, part 1 is set to hit Netflix on July 6 with the second half arriving a month later on August 3.</p>
<p> What To Expect From The Lincoln Lawyer Season 2 </p>
<p>Skipping over the third, <a href="https://screenrant.com/lincoln-lawyer-season-2-netflix-which-book/">The Lincoln Lawyer season 2 is based on the fourth book</a> in Connelly&#8217;s series titled The Fifth Witness, which finds Mickey defending Lisa after she is suspected of murdering a wealthy real estate developer. The second season starts six months after the conclusion of the Trevor Elliot case from season 1 as Mickey is still riding high off winning the high-profile case before he is thrust into a new one. Mickey&#8217;s new case in season 2 will be complicated by his personal connection to it since he becomes emotionally attached to Lisa before defending her.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="https://screenrant.com/lincoln-lawyer-netflix-skip-book-3-good/">Why The Lincoln Lawyer Has To Skip Book 3 (&amp; Why It Should Do It Later)</a></p>
<p>Though the second season will introduce a new high-profile case for Mickey, it won&#8217;t forget about the lingering mystery involving the killer with the tattoo on his forearm. By continuing this overarching storyline from season 1 while also having Mickey take on new cases both big and small, The Lincoln Lawyer season 2 should strike a nice balance of continuing and new storylines. This should attract both returning and new audiences when the legal drama returns to Netflix this summer.</p>

The Amazon Prime docuseries <a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/shiny-happy-people-duggar-family-secrets/">Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets</a> has put Jill Duggar and her husband Derick Dillard in the spotlight, as the former 19 Kids and Counting star gets candid about her past and its secrets. A lot has happened between the 32-year-old Jill since she was last seen in the reality TV show. On that program, the devout Baptist Duggar family gave viewers a look into their strict Christian household and day-to-day lives. The show which premiered in September 2008 ended in May 2015, after 10 entertaining seasons, when allegations arose that Josh had molested four of his sisters.<br />

<p>Jill had come forward as a victim, but had seemingly forgiven her brother by then. Jill was introduced to her husband Dillard by her father Jim Bob Duggar. Jim had met Derick on a mission trip to Nepal in 2012. Jill and Dillard got married in June 2014. They welcomed two sons (Israel, born in 2015), and Samuel (whom Jill gave birth to in 2017). Jill was brought back to the world of reality TV in a spin-off called Counting On in 2015, along with a few other Duggar family members.</p>
<p> What Did Jill Duggar Do After Leaving Her Family? </p>
<p>Jill and Derick starred in six seasons of Counting On. However, she walked away from the reality TV series in 2017, ahead of its season 7 premiere in 2018. In 2022, Jill and Derick moved into a new home with their growing family, on the border of Oklahoma and Arkansas. “We moved!! It’s been a crazy several weeks for us, but we are finally settling into our new place!” Jill shared in her family blog. <a href="https://www.dillardfamily.com/2022/06/new-house-new-job-new-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DillardFamily</a>. She also revealed that Derick had a new job, He had been sworn in as an attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas, and then started the transfer process for his new public service job as a prosecutor in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Jill and Derick welcomed their third son, another boy, in July 2022. Jill appears to be a stay-at-home, while Derick is busy with his courtroom job. Jill announced that she would be releasing her Tell-All memoir in 2024. Called Counting the Cost, it outlines the changes they faced, “including lack of respect for boundaries, greed, manipulation, and betrayal,” as per <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs6dR2uAQAO/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jill</a>’s Instagram post. Jill then participated in Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets, which premiered on June 2, 2023.</p>
<p> Why Did Jill Duggar Leave? </p>
<p>Interestingly, Jill is the only Duggar kid who appears in the docuseries. According to <a href="https://www.nickiswift.com/258346/we-finally-know-why-jill-duggar-left-tlc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NickiSwift</a>, Jill and her Dillard family stopped filming for Counting On due to backlash. This happened when Derick&#8217;s controversial tweets about transgender co-star Jazz Jennings surfaced online.</p>
<p>In October 2020, Jill and Derick took to their YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yt7lWGck4k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DillardFamilyOfficial</a> to reveal that they left because they wanted to focus on pursuing their other passions. They added that they wished to, &#8220;pursue our own goals and everything.&#8221; They also noted that it was a, &#8220;good decision&#8221; for them, even if leaving their lives as reality TV stars behind was, &#8220;difficult.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t shed light on exactly what these goals were at the time.</p>
<p>Jill and Derick weren’t on the, “best terms” with some of her family after having disagreements, but looked forward to having some time to heal. &#8220;There&#8217;s been some distancing there,&#8221; Jill had said about her relationship with her family. However, she did not name any members in particular. In Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets, Jill looks back at her family’s fall from grace, and Josh&#8217;s scandal, while opening up about her life and upbringing as a Duggar.</p>
