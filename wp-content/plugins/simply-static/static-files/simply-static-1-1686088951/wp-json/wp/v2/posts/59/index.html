This is a regular aspect of getting older, but it can be made worse by being overweight, having an injury, or having a medical condition. There are several symptoms of arthritis and joint discomfort in cats, and we discuss some below:1. One symptom is a decrease in your cat\u2019s activity level and an increase in immobility. When they walk or try to get up from a lying posture, they may appear stiff.<br \/>2. In addition to mobility issues, you may find that your cat may seem not to show interest in most things in its surroundings. They could be sleeping longer and being less active than usual.<br \/>3. Your cat may be in pain if they show discomfort when you touch them near their joints or howl when you lift them up. They may be showing discomfort if you find that touching the area around their neck, back, or legs causes them distress. Limping or an unusual gait may be an indication of joint pain.<br \/>4. A loss in appetite is a common side effect of\u00a0joint discomfort because it makes eating and moving about more challenging. Cats suffering from joint pain can experience weight loss due to their decreased appetite.<br \/>5. they may exhibit changes in grooming behavior. Cats with joint pain may have trouble grooming themselves, which can lead to changes in the cat\u2019s appearance and smell.<\/p>\n<p>How Can Regular Vet Check-Ups Help?<\/p>\n<p>While arthritis cannot be cured, it can be treated, and your cat can be helped to maintain an easier life. Having your pet examined by a veterinarian regularly is a significant first step. Your vet can prescribe pain medication and suggest nutritional supplements and dietary adjustments.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Arthritic cats can be treated with various options, including medication, vitamins, physical therapy, weight management, and even acupuncture. Your senior cat can enjoy a long and happy life with your gentle care. <\/p>\n<p>Visiting the vet regularly will also help detect other problems, such as kidney disease or diabetes, in their early stages. So, to keeping your senior cat healthy and happy requires routine visits to the vet.<\/p>\n<p>Read also: <a href=\"https:\/\/kiiky.com\/wealth\/healthy-paws-pet-insurance\/\">Healthy Paws Pet Insurance Reviews 2022<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Tips to Keep Senior Cats Moving Despite Joint Issues<\/p>\n<p>1.
